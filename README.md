# 337FinalBounceBackCalculator
Web program that checks stocks for the most volatile single day drops on open. Works loosely on the daytrading concept of bounce back. Probably not an actually good tool for investing unless intimate knowledge of the stocks is known and portolio is diverse. No actual server. Instead, uses Express to mimic server on localhost.
